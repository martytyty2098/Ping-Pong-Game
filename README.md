# Ping-Pong-Game
My Ping Pong Game made in C++ (win32)

This game can only be run on windows

You need to make sure that every .cpp file is in the same directory, but you dont need any of them to run pong.exe, you can just double click on it and play

or you can copy & paste the whole thing from pong_sauce_code.txt

You can resize the game window as you want.

(main function is placed in win32_platform.cpp)
